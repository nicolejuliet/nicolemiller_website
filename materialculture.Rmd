Material culture is the attribution of meaning to objects by the people who produce, use, consume, sell and collect them (Riello, 2011). It isn't a term for the object itself, but instead refers to the way objects take on meaning. Material culture seeks to understand the role of a garment within a specific society and time (2011). A garment that signifies something to one person may signify something completely different to another. Material items are able to be interpreted differently specifically based on context and culture. The following paper will be analysing a plaid uniform skirt and specifically look into the topics the garment may raise. These topics further analyze fashion and how it can relate to sex, gender, sexualization and identity.  

The image below shows a navy blue and white plaid skirt. From just looking at it, the skirt appears to be pretty ordinary. However it's important to note that this skirt used to be part of a high school uniform. The blue and white on the skirt is representative of the school's official colors. The fabric content is made up of 100% polyester and it's evident that the skirt was machine made. The waist is stretched out from the amount of times it had been rolled in order to appear shorter without having to do any alterations. When turning the skirt inside out, it's evident that material has been cut. This is because the skirt was actually a skort in its original form. The short part had been cut out in order to make the skirt easier to roll up, along with being more breathable and comfortable to wear. Students who needed to purchase the skirt or any other uniform garments would order them online from a family owned retailer of high-quality school uniforms. The garments all ranged in prices depending on what was being purchased. The image next to the skirt gives an estimated price range for various uniform skirts. All skirt options are around the \$50 price range. Boy's trousers are in the \$30-40 price range, making them a slightly more affordable option. The required shoes for both genders are around \$100. Most students tend to own a range of uniform garments that they can mix and match with, making the cost go up even more. The uniforms aren't cheap but it's important to note that these garments are meant to be worn for 4 years. If students are caught violating the uniform code in any way, they are normally written up and given detention. This also applies to skirts being rolled and shortened.

Uniforms have been around for a long time. According to a fashion historian named Rebecca C. Toute, "The 1920s is often credited as the decade that gave rise to the earliest version of the schoolgirl uniform we know today -- middy blouse and deep pleated skirt that fell to below the knee" (Oliver, 2017). She went on to say how the 1930s and 1940s took inspiration from boy's uniforms and menswear in response to wartime issues (2017). However it was the 1950s that formed the classic image of the school girl uniform and plaid skirt we recognize today. One of the reasons that school uniforms were originally introduced was to hide and mask the financial inequality present in schools. This is still a reason behind why many schools say they use uniforms today. According to an article written by Mary-Holland Thompson, "Uniforms level the playing field because they make it difficult to determine who is affluent and who is not. They remove the need to compete in clothing fads and eliminate feelings of inferiority for students unable to keep up with trends, thereby fostering improved self-confidence and esteem in students" (Thompson, 1999). School uniforms are meant to be seen as equalizers. In other words, when students are dressed the same there can be no distinctions of social class or wealth (Dussel, 2005). However, the opposite can still be said in regards to this issue. The role of a uniform can also be to mark out specific people and indicate membership of a group in a social environment (Sterman, 2011). Uniforms can in fact indicate that a student is wealthy. This is because many private schools that are extremely expensive require their students to wear uniforms. These students belong to an elite institution and the uniforms they wear signify that they are financially superior than most. This is how school uniforms are able to identify an individual as being a part of a particular class and social division.

The plaid skirt is the garment that is most associated with the school uniform. Unfortunately, it has also become associated with the increasing sexualization of girls who wear school uniforms. According to David Crockett and Melanie Wallendorf, "School uniforms are intended to mask and repress class distinctions, but they can also be viewed as masking and attempting to repress female sexuality" (Crockett & Wallendorf, 1998). Girls are normally required to wear knee-length skirts and show as little skin as possible. They are the ones who are more commonly disciplined for certain articles of attire that are prohibited simply because they "distract" boys. These girls are given the impression that boys will always objectify them and they need to dress a certain way as a result. This mindset is what leads to a sense of rebellion, whether that be through the rolling up of skirts. Skirt rolling can simply be seen as a response from the girls who feel like their sexuality is being repressed. Nancy Lesko, a researcher who specifically addresses gender issues in school uniforms, argues that dress code policies emphasizing modesty and restraint perpetuate the belief that girls' bodies and sexualities are in particular need of control (Lesko, 1998). Regardless of whether it is intentional or not, the exposure of legs and thighs carry sexual meaning and school girls become the main targets of this through the compulsory wearing of skirts. As Gilbert and Taylor observe, "Girls are 'taught', early on, specific aspects of femininity (in particular here modesty and immodesty) through this particular garment" (Gilbert & Taylor, 1991). The plaid skirt has become a controversial uniform garment for girls simply because boys have applied a sexual meaning to it. 

The sexy school girl is a great example of the way in which fashion can be sexualized. The sexy school girl image tends to be associated with a short plaid skirt, knee high socks, and a low-cut button down blouse. In today's world, the youth can be seen as objects of desire since some men are attracted to the idea of innocence. However, the school girl also became a significant image in society mainly due to pop culture and music icons. Britney Spears wore a Catholic school girl uniform in her music video of "Baby One More Time," and this is an image that is still significant today. In her book The Lolita Effect, M. Gigi Durham describes Brittany Spears' famous 1998 photoshoot in which she wore schoolgirl-inspired clothing (Durham, 2008). Durham suggests that the portrayal of an innocent schoolgirl played a significant role in Spears' rise in popularity (2008). Millions of people saw the music video and photoshoot, which only resulted in more exposure. Unfortunately the school girl image has become even more of a fetish and the girls who simply wear a plaid skirt are often sexualized. In Japan, the uniformed schoolgirl is constantly featured in erotic manga, illustrations, and magazines (Kinsella, 2002). The Japanese even have a term for the school girl image which is called kogal (2002). It is by far the most sexualized out of all the uniforms in Japanese culture. The school girl uniform truly represents the meaning of sexualized fashion. 

School uniform garments can also raise a conversation about fashion and how it may impose standards of gender from a young age. Schools that require students to wear a formal uniform almost universally provide trousers for boys and plaid skirts for girls. This becomes a problem when a student doesn't identify as their perceived gender. The skirts differentiate the male from the female and confirm traditional gender identities for students who must wear the correct attire corresponding to their sex (Bennett, 2015). In the Journal of Gender Studies, Alison Happel states that "While there is no one objective 'meaning' to a skirt (since there are cultures throughout history in which the 'skirt' is worn by a male), in this context, skirts differentiate the female from the male. They are the physical markers of sex and gender (and conflate the two) confirming 'traditional' gender identities. They have, therefore, implications for how girls are treated, viewed, and, most importantly here, for how they are able to move" (Happel, 2013). In other words, the enforcement of skirt-wearing is not applied to male students and therefore conforms to a particular type of gender performance (2013). Girls who wear skirts are expected to perform a certain way and the same can be said for boys who wear trousers. Schools that enforce their students to wear attire that corresponds with their sex are directly assigning how these students must perform, even if it is opposite from their identified gender. These schools are making the mistake of aligning gender and sex which aren't the same at all. This creates an issue when a student does not want to identify with a gender that does not align with their sex. 

Clearly, the imposition of a school uniform can create a site for conflict. The plaid skirt is a garment that illustrates how issues of class, sexuality and gender intersect. The traditional school girl image is always associated with a plaid skirt and brings up various topics of discussion. It is a garment that has provoked a lot of controversy, yet is still used so much today. It will be interesting to see how the plaid skirt will evolve over time and what topics it will shed light to in the future. Performing a material culture analysis on a plaid skirt has truly shown how much meaning a single garment can carry.
