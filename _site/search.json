      "contents": "\nAs Miuccia Prada once said, “What you wear is how you present yourself to the world, especially today, when human contacts are so quick. Fashion is instant language.” The fashion industry is considered one of the largest and most impactful industries in the world today. Almost everyone is a direct consumer of fashion, and the industry is one that contributes a lot to the global economy. Fashion helps people define themselves and has become a powerful tool of influence. However, the world of fashion would not be the way it is today without advertising. Advertising in the fashion industry is crucial if brands want to be recognized and it’s the easiest way to communicate with consumers. As a result, it can be said that fashion and advertising go hand in hand. \nOne of the most fascinating parts about fashion is that it attracts multiple types of consumers. There really isn’t a specific mold that a person has to fit into. In my opinion, this is what makes the fashion industry so diverse and much more interesting. Regardless of whether you are interested in fashion or not, everyone wears clothes and is a direct consumer of the industry in some way. However, fashion is also extremely influential. Many fashion consumers are influenced by their peers’ preferences and institutional power (Oran, 2019). Celebrities, role models, or even popular peer group members can become fashion leaders and influence the way people dress (2019). Many consumers view fashion as a status symbol and buy clothes that represent how they want others to perceive them. Others choose to shop at fast fashion stores and only care about getting the best deal. The customers in fashion vary, which is what makes the industry much more unique and exciting. \nThere are many different types of fashion advertising. To begin with, print advertising and billboards were some of the original ways in which fashion was advertised. Magazines are a major sector for fashion advertising campaigns, especially for luxury brands (How Fashion Advertising Promotes Fashion Brands, 2014). When fashion campaigns are published in magazines such as Vogue or Bazaar, millions of people are exposed to it. The same goes for billboards. If a fashion campaign is put on a billboard in Times Square or 5th Avenue, it reaches a magnitude of people. Fashion ads also utilize TV commercials. Storytelling is extremely important in the commercial of a fashion campaign. This is because customers will likely buy a product if they feel emotionally connected to it in some way. Most of the time fashion brands are using commercials to advertise their entry-level products so they can target a wide range of audiences (2014). These ads will be seen by anyone who owns a TV, resulting in high exposure. Luxury brands will also use high profile individuals and celebrities to advertise their designs. For example, when a celebrity is photographed wearing a specific designer, a consumer will see the image and want to buy the same outfit for themself. This is why street style has become a prominent influence in fashion, and is another way that fashion advertising is able to target a potential consumer. \nIn today’s world, digital advertising has become the main way to advertise and this applies to the fashion industry as well. Many brands are taking advantage of social media platforms and using them to advertise their products. Technology has encouraged people to interact with brands and has changed the way of communication between the brand and consumer (How Fashion Advertising Promotes Fashion Brands, 2014). According to The Wall Street Journal, “Fashion houses such as Louis Vuitton and Gucci are shifting marketing dollars from print ads to digital channels such as social media and online advertising” (Kirkpatrick, 2017). François-Henri Pinault, chief executive of Kering, told the Wall Street Journal he estimates the company spends up to 40% of its communication budget on digital because that’s where the consumer is (LaRose, 2017). As a result of social media, fashion bloggers and influencers have been able to become advertisements themselves. They are directly promoting the brand by wearing its clothes. Companies now send digital influencers PR packages in hopes that they will be photographed in the clothing. In fact, many luxury fashion brands are sending influencers to Fashion Week and having them sit front row at their shows in exchange for them posting content on their social media pages. Fast fashion brands are also capitalizing on influencer advertising. H&M launched a social media influencer program with 22 social media personalities serving as ambassadors. These influencers will be delivering content directly to consumers through their own Instagram accounts during the yearlong partnership (Edelson, 4). Clearly, influencer advertising has proven to be an effective new way for fashion brands to advertise their products. \nDepending on the brand and its values, fashion ads hold different messages. Recently, a lot of fashion ads have messages relating to sustainability and body acceptance. However this has not always been the case. In the past, many fashion ads objectified women and utilized the message of “sex sells”. For example, Calvin Klein published an ad in 1992 that featured a young Kate Moss and Mark Wahlberg. In the ad, 17 year old Moss was topless and at one point Wahlberg points to her and says “Now that could definitely come between me and my Calvins.” Even by today’s standards, the ad is considered provocative and unapologetically sexual. Not only that, but Moss was seen as an unrealistic and unattainable role model for the young women the commercial was targeting mainly due to her “underfed” frame and “heroin chic” appearance (Phelps, 2017). Thankfully, fashion ads today seem to have stepped away from their old ways and are making the effort to put out ads that neither objectify women or depict unrealistic standards of beauty. \nIf I were to choose a dream company to work for, it would be Vogue. Not only is Vogue the most famous and recognized fashion and lifestyle magazine in the world, but it is universally known as fashion’s bible. The magazine was founded in 1892 and was a weekly periodical that was subscribed to by New York’s elite (Borrelli, n.d). Condé Nast then bought the company in 1909 and began to transform it into the fashion powerhouse it is today (n.d). Nast insisted that the covers were done by the best photographers and illustrators in the industry. As a result, each Vogue cover became a representation of the movements in each decade. Vogue today is not only extremely influential, but is edited by the most powerful woman currently in the fashion industry, Anna Wintour (Tangdall, 2017). As a result, Vogue claims to be a magazine that empowers women through its strong female editors, writers, designers, and models (2017). \nVogue is my dream company for many reasons. To begin with, there is a certain level of prestige you carry if you land a job with Vogue and it is a dream company for most fashion lovers. Vogue was also the first magazine I grew up reading and it introduced me to the fashion world. Growing up, I would always look forward to receiving my new issue of Vogue and it was where I went to get any sort of inspiration. Ideally, I want to work for a company that will challenge me creatively and won’t necessarily be a traditional desk job. Simply from doing research about the company, I know that Vogue is a place where no day is the same. I want a job that isn’t repetitive and where the company atmosphere is engaging. The people who work at Vogue all have a similar level of work ethic or else they wouldn’t have been hired. It is a company that truly has so many different elements to it, and this is something that attracts me. Finally, a dream of mine has always been to attend Fashion Week and there are only a limited number of companies that could potentially make this happen for me. Fashion month is considered to be the most important time of the year in fashion and if you work for a big fashion brand or magazine, odds are you will be involved in it. Being able to attend Fashion Week being associated with a company like Vogue would be surreal and is a goal that I hope to achieve in the future.\nVogue is extremely selective about the advertisements they choose to display in their magazines. In fact, British Vogue has said that “Vogue’s ads are as important as the content” (Southern, 2015). The ads in Vogue are considered premium, and readers tend to value them as much as they would the content (2015). According to Vogue’s associate publisher Sallie Berkerey, their ads are described as “genuine,” “trusted” and “appealing” (2015). Many of the ads in Vogue are by prestigious, luxury brands who are using the magazine to support their ad campaigns. Vogue’s advertising is mainly targeted to those with a high-income. Their advertisements tend to be relevant and valued, and many readers take action as a result of seeing advertising in Vogue (Advertising in Vogue, n.d). Additionally, Vogue has really made an effort to transition into the digital advertising space and release all of their magazines digitally in addition to print. In fact, Vogue was the first brand to pioneer new standout video content in June 2015, with the launch of Vogue Video (Geary, 2015). This proved to be an absolute success and many of their competitors ended up implementing the same strategy. Vogue’s video content receives millions of views and this number is only increasing as they continue to adapt digitally. The brand has proven that they know how to successfully complement print and digital, and they always aim to produce something unique. Somehow, they continue to have high success rates for both digital and print, which is incredibly rare in this new digital age. This is what makes Vogue stand out from their competitors. \nIn 2019, Vogue announced the launch of ‘Vogue Values’, which is a global mission statement adopted by all 26 editions of the magazine and articulates the shared commitments for 2020 and beyond (“Vogue Values”, 2019). Each editor in chief of Vogue signed their name to this statement and it’s a testament to the power of the global brand when it speaks with a collective voice (2019). The last sentence in the statement reads, “We speak with a unified voice across 26 editions standing for the values of diversity, responsibility and respect for individuals, communities and for our natural environment” (2019). This campaign is just one way Vogue continues to attract more readers, build loyalty, and make themselves more attractive than their competitors. Vogue believes that their readers expect them to be socially responsible, represent people from all backgrounds, and have a strong voice on current affairs and global issues (Vogue Announces Vogue Values, 2019). Roger Lynch, the CEO of Condé Nast says, “Vogue has the ability to move, influence and inspire — and with that, a responsibility to lead on the issues that matter most” (2019). As the world’s leading fashion title, Vogue knows how to keep their audience happy and is an example of a company that listens to what their readers want. The advertising they choose to display in each issue represents not only the luxury element of the brand, but also the ethics. Vogue is consistent and as a result, readers are able to connect with them. \nThere are so many different ways to advertise Vogue, but I believe that social media is the best method, as it has already proven to be extremely successful. Youtube, Instagram, and Facebook would be the three main platforms I would focus advertising on. Facebook would target the middle to older aged readers, since it’s the platform that older generations seem to prefer. Instagram and Youtube would mainly advertise to the millenial and Gen Z audience. It’s also important for Vogue ads to depict the magazine’s beliefs. For instance if I were to come up with an ad focusing on Vogue’s sustainability efforts, the ad would show an illustrated image of a girl holding a pile of used Vogue issues in her hands deciding whether to toss them in the garbage right in front of her or walk the extra mile and put them in the donation/recycling bin. The headline would say “Waste it or preserve it. The choice is yours. Go Green with Vogue.” It’s important that the ad is illustrated because it will reduce the environmental impact of photoshoots, making the ad even more powerful. This ad could be a part of Vogue’s sustainability campaign and would be shown across all of their platforms. It could even be made into a video series and use emotion to draw people in. If the ad campaign is successful, there will be increased word of mouth resulting in more reach. It’s important for Vogue advertisements to connect with readers and remind them of why they choose to read Vogue over anyone else.\nOverall, the fashion industry is evolving and its ads are reflective of this. Vogue is a company that is adapting to change, which is how it is able to stay successful while many of its competitors are struggling. Vogue continues to remain a top name in fashion, and its values are reflective of those I want my future employer to have. It would be an absolute dream to work for a company like Vogue and be a part of their social media or digital advertising team. I hope to gain more experience in the fashion industry post graduation and work hard to be able to have the credentials to apply for a job at Vogue in the future. It’s important to take things one step at a time in any career and that is exactly what I plan to do. Move over Anna Wintour, here I come. \nReferences\nAdvertising in Vogue Magazine – The Media Ant.

      "description": "Here is a blog post that I created about an expat for my Cultural Environment of International Business class. \n",
      "author": [],
      "contents": "\nAndrew Braathan did not have the traditional upbringing. He grew up in Brazil and eventually moved to the United States to attend the University of Houston, where he studied Hotel and Restaurant Management. After completing his undergraduate degree, he began his career working for a cruise line company that was based in Miami. He worked in Miami for a couple of years but eventually received a job opportunity in Brazil and had to move back. However the transition back to Brazil wasn’t as easy as Andrew thought it would be and he had to relearn the Brazilian way of doing business. He ended up working in Brazil for another 13 years before making the move back to the United States in 2015 where he has been living ever since. After having lived half of his life in Brazil and the other half in the United States, Andrew has learned many cultural lessons that he was willing to share with anyone interested in working internationally one day. \nHaving to work in Brazil after beginning his professional career in the United States was a much harder transition for Andrew than vice versa. When he moved back to Brazil, he had to relearn how to communicate more formally with his clients and suppliers. The United States is also a much more individualistic culture than Brazil which meant that Andrew had to adjust his mindset to be more collectivistic. Brazilians strongly believe in placing the interests of others before their own, and there is an emphasis on trust and building long lasting relationships. It was difficult for Andrew to adjust back to a culture where group identity was emphasized and where an indirect communication style was more common. However when he moved back to the States, it was easier for Andrew to switch back to an individualistic mindset. \n\nAccording to Andrew, the biggest difference between doing business in the United States versus in Brazil is the interaction style. Contrary to the United States, Brazil has a much more formal and indirect communication style. This meant that Andrew couldn’t just say no and disagree with his colleagues in Brazil the same way he did in the States because they would take it personally. Communicating in an indirect way was a big challenge for Andrew since he was coming from the United States which has a very direct communication style. In addition to being more formal, Brazilians are much more informative than Americans and like to explain things before they ask you to do something. They want you to understand the reasoning behind a request to avoid any confusion about a particular task. “Brazilians like to give more information whereas over here in the States it’s a little bit more cut and dry,” Andrew recalled. \nAndrew’s main takeaway from working in both Brazil and the United States is that it’s so important to be flexible. Anyone who is looking to work internationally should be able to multitask and be open to doing different jobs at the same time. No matter how similar two countries may appear, there are always differences that will set them apart. Andrew’s ability to be flexible and adapt to the local culture and business environment in both the United States and Brazil is what has helped him succeed. Furthermore, having a diverse skill set and always being willing to learn new things is crucial when working abroad. \nAndrew’s advice for a future expat is to not be afraid to work in different parts of the world and explore various industries along the way. “Everything will help you be a better person, employee, business owner, etc because you have that experience,” he mentioned. Additionally, knowing more than one language is a skill that is so important to have. When he was working in Miami, Andrew watched firsthand how some people weren’t given as many opportunities simply because they couldn’t communicate with their employees. He saw his boss turn extremely qualified people down because they didn’t know Spanish. Knowing multiple languages is so important and can only benefit someone who is trying to integrate themselves into a new culture.\n\n\n\n\n",

      "title": "Children Are What They Eat",
      "description": "Here is a feature story I wrote about how childhood nutrition can affect adult life.\n",
      "author": [],
      "contents": "\nMaria Miller wished she had thought twice before giving her daughter Natalie that McDonald’s Happy Meal. \nNatalie is now 27 years old and has suffered from high cholesterol and high blood pressure for at least a decade. Miller believes that this is linked to her poor diet during pregnancy and the meals she fed Natalie as a child. \n“I was a single mom who was still working a full time job and never had time to properly cook meals at home,” Miller recalled. “I had a child to feed and the easiest thing to do was order cheap takeout throughout the week. In the moment I wasn’t thinking about the long term effects that decision could have in the future.”  \nMore research has come out about the impact childhood diet may have on adult life. Scientists have not only found links between childhood diet and metabolic diseases such as obesity, but also with mood disorders such as anxiety and depression. \nA recent 2021study conducted by researchers at the University of California, Riverside found that exercise and a healthy diet during childhood may lead to adults with bigger brains and lower levels of anxiety. \nMarcell Cadney, a physiology doctoral student at UCR, led the study and used mice to obtain these findings. The mice were split into four groups- those with access to exercise, those without access, those fed a standard, healthy diet and those fed a Western diet, which consisted of foods that were high in fat and sugar. \n“There are various aspects about our health that we’d like to understand and many of those aspects are undoubtedly driven by genetics,” Cadney said. “However another factor that might be important is our early life experiences. I personally wanted to know what sort of factors mice experience early in life that could have long lasting effects into adulthood.”\nCadney and his team discovered that the mice that had access to exercise and were fed a standard, healthy diet exhibited less anxiety like behaviors. On the contrary, the mice that were exposed to a Western diet since early life had an increased adult preference for foods high in fat, salt, and sugar. These findings can help explain the importance of exposure for healthy eating during childhood.  \nAlison Ventura, an associate professor at California Polytechnic State University whose research focuses on obesity prevention during early childhood, believes that parents are the ones who ultimately shape the types of foods their children are craving. \n“Children are very plastic, meaning that they change and learn so quickly, which helps them grow and develop,” Ventura said. “But this also means that there’s so much potential to shape healthy habits and preferences. The more that we can do during early childhood, then the easier that child will have as an adult in terms of being able to maintain a healthy body weight and practice healthy habits that will support their health throughout adulthood.”\nThis is what Miller considers to be her biggest failure as a parent. Since she had exposed Natalie to the Western diet at such an early age, high sodium and fatty foods seemed to be all she craved. \n“I honestly didn’t want to deal with the temper tantrums,” Miller admitted. “As a single mom, I was exhausted and already felt a tremendous amount of guilt. I took the easy route which was to just give her what she wanted. Unfortunately, what she wanted were foods high in fat and sugar.” \nSimilar to the mice, Natalie developed a preference for foods commonly associated with the Western diet. However according to Ventura, these preferences can be formed as early as pregnancy. This is because both amniotic fluid and breast milk contain molecules derived from the mother’s diet which are passed down to the fetus. \n“We know that prenatally the mom’s nutrition is really important because her diet can get transmitted to the fetus,” Ventura mentioned. “For example if the mom has a garlicky meal, that garlic flavor is going to be transmitted into the amniotic fluid, and then that little fetus is going to be bathed in garlic flavor. If that happens repeatedly then the fetus is going to learn to love garlic, and when that fetus becomes a child it’s going to recognize the flavor. The bottom line is that the mom’s diet is really critical for establishing this foundation of health for the baby, especially during the prenatal period.” \nThis is why women’s health and diet during pregnancy should not be ignored and is a topic that is severely lacking in discussion. Most women with unexpected pregnancies like Tsutsumi don’t realize the importance of nutrition during pregnancy. Oftentimes, the bad eating habits that are formed during pregnancy will stay consistent even after the child is born. \n“My diet during pregnancy was the exact opposite of healthy,” Miller recalled. “Not only was I eating fast food pretty much every day, but I was also consuming giant portions of it. I let myself eat whatever I wanted because I thought that was normal for pregnant women to do. I wish I hadn’t been so naive.” \nDaniel Hoffman, a professor in the department of nutritional sciences at Rutgers University, is worried about the way the new generation of parents will feed their children. He believes that the best thing parents can do is introduce their children to a variety of healthy foods from a young age without making a big deal about it. \n“When I was younger, I either ate what my mother made or I didn’t eat,” Hoffman said. “Nowadays, you’ll see kids refuse certain foods and what do parents do? They’ll give them something else. Behaviorally, they’re training children that if they say no they’ll get something else. But nationally, what’s happening is that parents usually end up giving their kids something sweet or salty instead.” \nHoffman encourages parents to think about the negative consequences that can occur from allowing children to refuse a meal and consume an unhealthy alternative instead. In fact, he believes that it is sometimes better for children to skip a meal rather than giving them the unhealthy food they really wanted, because this will have less of a long term impact on their health.\n“No child has died from skipping dinner,” Hoffman reiterated. “But the child may die later on from heart disease because the parents manipulated their preference for these less desirable foods. So the best advice I give to parents is to have healthy foods in the house, prepare healthy meals, and don’t offer alternatives.”\nIn Miller’s case, she worries that the health problems Natalie has faced are irreversible. However, researchers like Cadney strongly believe that it’s never too late to start working on your health. \n“What we learned from the mice is that regardless of their early life experiences, they all lost significant amounts of body fat after having two weeks of exercise,” Cadney said. “So that should tell you that regardless of what your genetics and life experiences were, you can start taking care of yourself today and that will have a significant effect on the risk factors of  cardiovascular disease, obesity, type two diabetes and so on.”\nCadney also worries about the children who are currently living through the COVID-19 pandemic and the future health implications they may face because of it. \n“Unfortunately in a couple decades we might see a sudden spike in obesity rates, in type two diabetes, and so on just because of these early life experiences children faced due to COVID,” Cadney mentioned. “Parents need to understand that their kids do need a consistent diet of healthy foods that they might have been getting at school, as well as time for recess. We need to have action plans of what to do with kids specifically, so that we avoid the trap that is set by these early life experiences following us into adulthood.”\nLuckily, Miller did not make the same mistakes during her second pregnancy and had a lot more help the next time around. Her son Ryan has grown up with a balanced diet and does not appear to have any underlying metabolic conditions like Natalie. The main message that Tsutsumi wants to get across to new parents is to not make the same mistakes she did. \n“Nobody really thinks about how the foods you eat from a young age may affect your long term health as an adult,” Miller said. “My daughter has luckily been able to get her health under control but she will always have to be careful about what she eats. As a parent, it’s not a fun feeling watching your child suffer and knowing that you may have contributed to it. I just want future moms to be more mindful of their nutrition during pregnancy and what they choose to feed their children throughout childhood.”\n\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "Here is the material culture analysis I wrote for a fashion marketing class I took in London.\n",
      "author": [],
      "contents": "\nMaterial culture is the attribution of meaning to objects by the people who produce, use, consume, sell and collect them (Riello, 2011). It isn’t a term for the object itself, but instead refers to the way objects take on meaning. Material culture seeks to understand the role of a garment within a specific society and time (2011). A garment that signifies something to one person may signify something completely different to another. Material items are able to be interpreted differently specifically based on context and culture. The following paper will be analysing a plaid uniform skirt and specifically look into the topics the garment may raise. These topics further analyze fashion and how it can relate to sex, gender, sexualization and identity.  \nThe image below shows a navy blue and white plaid skirt. From just looking at it, the skirt appears to be pretty ordinary. However it’s important to note that this skirt used to be part of a high school uniform. The blue and white on the skirt is representative of the school’s official colors. The fabric content is made up of 100% polyester and it’s evident that the skirt was machine made. The waist is stretched out from the amount of times it had been rolled in order to appear shorter without having to do any alterations. When turning the skirt inside out, it’s evident that material has been cut. This is because the skirt was actually a skort in its original form. The short part had been cut out in order to make the skirt easier to roll up, along with being more breathable and comfortable to wear. Students who needed to purchase the skirt or any other uniform garments would order them online from a family owned retailer of high-quality school uniforms. The garments all ranged in prices depending on what was being purchased. The image next to the skirt gives an estimated price range for various uniform skirts. All skirt options are around the $50 price range. Boy’s trousers are in the $30-40 price range, making them a slightly more affordable option. The required shoes for both genders are around $100. Most students tend to own a range of uniform garments that they can mix and match with, making the cost go up even more. The uniforms aren’t cheap but it’s important to note that these garments are meant to be worn for 4 years. If students are caught violating the uniform code in any way, they are normally written up and given detention. This also applies to skirts being rolled and shortened. \n\nUniforms have been around for a long time. According to a fashion historian named Rebecca C. Toute, “The 1920s is often credited as the decade that gave rise to the earliest version of the schoolgirl uniform we know today – middy blouse and deep pleated skirt that fell to below the knee” (Oliver, 2017). She went on to say how the 1930s and 1940s took inspiration from boy’s uniforms and menswear in response to wartime issues (2017). However it was the 1950s that formed the classic image of the school girl uniform and plaid skirt we recognize today. One of the reasons that school uniforms were originally introduced was to hide and mask the financial inequality present in schools. This is still a reason behind why many schools say they use uniforms today. According to an article written by Mary-Holland Thompson, “Uniforms level the playing field because they make it difficult to determine who is affluent and who is not. They remove the need to compete in clothing fads and eliminate feelings of inferiority for students unable to keep up with trends, thereby fostering improved self-confidence and esteem in students” (Thompson, 1999). School uniforms are meant to be seen as equalizers. In other words, when students are dressed the same there can be no distinctions of social class or wealth (Dussel, 2005). However, the opposite can still be said in regards to this issue. The role of a uniform can also be to mark out specific people and indicate membership of a group in a social environment (Sterman, 2011). Uniforms can in fact indicate that a student is wealthy. This is because many private schools that are extremely expensive require their students to wear uniforms. These students belong to an elite institution and the uniforms they wear signify that they are financially superior than most. This is how school uniforms are able to identify an individual as being a part of a particular class and social division. \n\nThe plaid skirt is the garment that is most associated with the school uniform. Unfortunately, it has also become associated with the increasing sexualization of girls who wear school uniforms. According to David Crockett and Melanie Wallendorf, “School uniforms are intended to mask and repress class distinctions, but they can also be viewed as masking and attempting to repress female sexuality” (Crockett & Wallendorf, 1998). Girls are normally required to wear knee-length skirts and show as little skin as possible. They are the ones who are more commonly disciplined for certain articles of attire that are prohibited simply because they “distract” boys. These girls are given the impression that boys will always objectify them and they need to dress a certain way as a result. This mindset is what leads to a sense of rebellion, whether that be through the rolling up of skirts. Skirt rolling can simply be seen as a response from the girls who feel like their sexuality is being repressed. Nancy Lesko, a researcher who specifically addresses gender issues in school uniforms, argues that dress code policies emphasizing modesty and restraint perpetuate the belief that girls’ bodies and sexualities are in particular need of control (Lesko, 1998). Regardless of whether it is intentional or not, the exposure of legs and thighs carry sexual meaning and school girls become the main targets of this through the compulsory wearing of skirts. As Gilbert and Taylor observe, “Girls are ‘taught’, early on, specific aspects of femininity (in particular here modesty and immodesty) through this particular garment” (Gilbert & Taylor, 1991). The plaid skirt has become a controversial uniform garment for girls simply because boys have applied a sexual meaning to it. \nThe sexy school girl is a great example of the way in which fashion can be sexualized. The sexy school girl image tends to be associated with a short plaid skirt, knee high socks, and a low-cut button down blouse. In today’s world, the youth can be seen as objects of desire since some men are attracted to the idea of innocence. However, the school girl also became a significant image in society mainly due to pop culture and music icons. Britney Spears wore a Catholic school girl uniform in her music video of “Baby One More Time,” and this is an image that is still significant today. In her book The Lolita Effect, M. Gigi Durham describes Brittany Spears’ famous 1998 photoshoot in which she wore schoolgirl-inspired clothing (Durham, 2008). Durham suggests that the portrayal of an innocent schoolgirl played a significant role in Spears’ rise in popularity (2008). Millions of people saw the music video and photoshoot, which only resulted in more exposure. Unfortunately the school girl image has become even more of a fetish and the girls who simply wear a plaid skirt are often sexualized. In Japan, the uniformed schoolgirl is constantly featured in erotic manga, illustrations, and magazines (Kinsella, 2002). The Japanese even have a term for the school girl image which is called kogal (2002). It is by far the most sexualized out of all the uniforms in Japanese culture. The school girl uniform truly represents the meaning of sexualized fashion. \nSchool uniform garments can also raise a conversation about fashion and how it may impose standards of gender from a young age. Schools that require students to wear a formal uniform almost universally provide trousers for boys and plaid skirts for girls. This becomes a problem when a student doesn’t identify as their perceived gender. The skirts differentiate the male from the female and confirm traditional gender identities for students who must wear the correct attire corresponding to their sex (Bennett, 2015). In the Journal of Gender Studies, Alison Happel states that “While there is no one objective ‘meaning’ to a skirt (since there are cultures throughout history in which the ‘skirt’ is worn by a male), in this context, skirts differentiate the female from the male. They are the physical markers of sex and gender (and conflate the two) confirming ‘traditional’ gender identities. They have, therefore, implications for how girls are treated, viewed, and, most importantly here, for how they are able to move” (Happel, 2013). In other words, the enforcement of skirt-wearing is not applied to male students and therefore conforms to a particular type of gender performance (2013). Girls who wear skirts are expected to perform a certain way and the same can be said for boys who wear trousers. Schools that enforce their students to wear attire that corresponds with their sex are directly assigning how these students must perform, even if it is opposite from their identified gender. These schools are making the mistake of aligning gender and sex which aren’t the same at all. This creates an issue when a student does not want to identify with a gender that does not align with their sex. \nClearly, the imposition of a school uniform can create a site for conflict. The plaid skirt is a garment that illustrates how issues of class, sexuality and gender intersect. The traditional school girl image is always associated with a plaid skirt and brings up various topics of discussion. It is a garment that has provoked a lot of controversy, yet is still used so much today. It will be interesting to see how the plaid skirt will evolve over time and what topics it will shed light to in the future. Performing a material culture analysis on a plaid skirt has truly shown how much meaning a single garment can carry. \nReferences\nBennett, Susan. (2015).

      "description": "Here is a short paper I wrote for my Global Sports Marketing class that explains the importance of sports marketing in recent years.\n",
      "author": [],
      "contents": "\nThe world of sports marketing has grown tremendously within the past few years, especially in the US and UK. Its growth can be contributed to many things, however there are specific areas that have proved to be the biggest reason for its success. Advertising, technology and social media are components that have helped sports marketing in both countries immensely.\nAdvertising has had a great impact on sports marketing. It allows the sports industry to spread messages on a vast scale while reaching multitudes of people (Thomas, 2019). Successful advertising leads to successful branding, which is essential for sports marketers to succeed. Educational advertising is a type of advertising that the sports marketing industry has successfully capitalized on. By definition, educational advertising involves using an educational platform to advertise. Daniel Geey, one of the UK’s most highly respected sports lawyers, is an example of someone in the industry who has used educational advertising to his advantage. Geey has spoken at global conferences on topics involving football broadcasting rights, multiple club ownership and third party ownership (Geey, n.d). He has written a book called “Done Deal” that educates readers on the inner workings of football and the incidents he has dealt with first hand. Geey also launched a podcast where listeners can be informed about the football industry and hear about topics relating to the sport. Geey has built an impressive following because of these accomplishments, resulting in him being one of the most sought-after advisers for players, agents and clubs. He is a great example of how educational advertising can attract more attention to the sports industry. \nWomen in sports is another topic that has contributed to educational advertising, in both the US and UK. A Nielsen Sports report stated that 84% of general sports fans find women’s sport more “inspiring” and “progressive” than the male version, which is seen by many as being more “money driven” (The Nielsen Company, 2018). These figures reveal the public’s receptiveness to women’s sports and the opportunity it presents for sports marketers to explore (Mulcahy, 2019). Equality, diversity and inclusion make brands more attractive to consumers and this is something that many sports companies are beginning to capitalize on. For example, women’s sport was the focus of Nike’s ‘Dream Crazier’ campaign. Starring tennis legend Serena Williams, the ad was an open call for women in sports to fight back against gender bias and unfair stereotyping (2019). The advertisement was a huge success for Nike and is an example of the importance advertising plays in sports marketing. Similarly, Sport England had a successful campaign titled “This Girl Can.” This campaign confronted the issue of gender gap in sports participation between males and females in the UK. Its purpose was to encourage females to participate in sports and make it more relevant to them (Bashford, 2018). The ads ended up being a groundbreaking success and resulted in 2.8 million women engaging in more active lifestyles (Sport England, 2020). These two examples illustrate the importance of sports advertising in both countries. \nTechnology has also impacted sports marketing, especially in the way consumers watch sport today. With easy access to search engines such as Google, people have full access to the world of sports. Fans can simply search their interests and be exposed to thousands of results. Furthermore, technology has allowed sports organizations to engage with fans digitally, while also increasing the visibility of the teams. Fans are able to stream sports and watch games from their mobile devices. However, social broadcasting has become the real game-changer. Every time a Facebook post about an NFL game broadcast is shared during the 15 minutes prior to kickoff, 1,000 additional viewers tune in for the first minute of play, as shown by the figure below. If it weren’t for technology, sports would not reach the level of viewership it has today. \n\n\n\nThe growth of technology has contributed to the importance of social media channels. A big trend in sports marketing involves shifting to new and different platforms (Bashford, 2018). Social media is a great way for brands to advertise themselves for free. Instead of increasing the advertising budget, companies can use their social media pages to improve the visibility of games and events. Fans can then share the posts with their friends, extending the brand’s reach without any additional costs. The graph below illustrates the increase in social media activity at the time of the Wimbledon tennis tournament from 2012-2014. In 2012, the Twitter mentions about the tournament were 2.5 million. One year later, the mentions grew to 5.7 million and by 2014, they were at 6 million. In just two years the Wimbledon Twitter mentions increased by 3.5 million, clearly illustrating the impact social media has had on sports.\n\nAdditionally, brand to fan communication is easier because of social media. These platforms present a humanized version of athletes and offer round-the-clock access to the sport (Business Wire, 2019). As a result, many sports marketers have taken advantage of influencer marketing. Sports brands use influencers to increase brand awareness, promote their merchandise and gain ticket sales. Influencer marketing can boost a brand’s reputation and attract new people, resulting in increased business volume. Leveraging influencers is a great way for sports teams, leagues and organizations to engage with new audiences outside their typical fanbase (Gittleman 2019). Even athletes themselves have become sports influencers. Portuguese footballer Crisitano Ronaldo has 203.7 million Instagram followers arguably making him one of the world’s top sports influencers. His influence is so great that he received nearly $1 billion in revenue for his sponsors through social media, according to Forbes (Badenhausen, 2017). Ronaldo’s influence is just one example of the impact influencer marketing has in this industry. \nSports marketing has clearly become an integral part of the sports world, and areas such as advertising and technology have contributed to its continued success. Educational advertising, and the use of social media/influencers are specific examples of how advertising and technology have benefited sports marketing in both the UK and US. All of these components have proved to be most effective in the sports marketing world and will likely continue to grow in importance for years to come.\nReferences\nBadenhausen, K. (2017, July 12).

      "title": "A Visual Analysis of Harrods Department Store",
      "description": "Here is a visual analysis paper I wrote for a fashion marketing class I took when I studied abroad in London. \n",
      "author": [],
      "contents": "\nHarrods is universally recognized as one of the most famous department stores in the world. It is considered to be one of the most glamorous shopping experiences in London, resulting in it becoming somewhat of a tourist attraction itself. In fact, Harrods has been named the world’s best performing luxury department store (IDEX Magazine, 2019). With 7 floors and 330 departments, Harrods is a shopping lover’s dream. All of the elements that make up Harrods is reflective of the prestige it carries and its interior truly reveals the brand’s identity. \nEver since Harrods opened, its motto has been ‘Omnia Omnibus Ubique’. This is a Latin phrase, which means “All things, for all people, everywhere” (History of Harrods department store, 2010). This motto is incredibly fitting because throughout the store’s entire history, it has sold a wide assortment of goods. It started out as a small grocery store in 1849, and then expanded rapidly because of its success (2010). By the 1950s, it had become society’s favorite store not only in London, but worldwide. Harrods has always been known for its service and the huge range of merchandise it carries from all over the world. The Harrods building that is present today was built in 1905 and has 330 departments, 20 restaurants, a food hall, a bank, a hair and beauty salon, and much more (Store Guide - Harrods, n.d.). The store still sells gourmet grocery items, however its emphasis is now placed on luxury clothing. When customers enter Harrods, they enter a different world where every experience is truly unique. \nThe interior of Harrods is unlike any other department store. The architecture and interior design are what initially attract the most attention when walking in. At the door, Harrods customers are immediately greeted by a doorman dressed in a sharp green and gold uniform. These are the iconic colors that customers associate the Harrods brand with. Inside the building, there are gold accents everywhere and it truly feels as though a person has entered an opulent kingdom. To put it simply, the inside of Harrods is spectacular. The store has a Renaissance-style interior, with the ceilings and frescos being painted and modeled by French artists in the Renaissance style (Orr, 2019). Giant columns take up various parts of the building and there are Egyptian accents everywhere. This is because Harrods used to be owned by Al Fayed, an Egyptian businessman who incorporated many Egyptian elements into the design of the store (History of Harrods department store, 2010). The bronze Eqyptian escalators also make up a key sculptural element in the building. The food hall is lavishly decorated with beautiful tiles and has hundreds of delicious gourmet food options. Each floor in Harrods has its own theme and customers can spend hours exploring the entirety of the store. The dim lighting present throughout the store gives the clothes a more intimate and high-end feel. The music plays softly in the background and creates the perfect ambiance for shoppers to explore and walk around in. There is an elegance to Harrods and it’s clear that the atmosphere caters to specific individuals, preferably those with money. Each department in Harrods can be seen as a showcase for luxury goods. It is not a place where children are seen running around aimlessly. The interior is truly timeless and reflects the level of prestige and high status the store holds. \nThe Harrods customer can be divided into two categories: the rich and the tourists. It is apparent that the store is targeted to the upper class, and this is clearly the market segment that management focuses the most on. The visitors at Harrods may be of all different age groups, however most of the shoppers belong to a higher class and expect the service and appearance of the store to reflect that. The book Consumerism: As a Way of Life states that “Fashion not only identifies the individual as being a member of a particular class, but also highlights that he or she is not a member of an alternative group” (Miles, 1998). This is extremely true for Harrods customers. By routinely shopping at Harrods, individuals are placing themselves in a particular social class whether they are intending to or not. A person who shops at Harrods is giving off the impression that they are of a higher status than most. This means that the experience of shopping at Harrods is expected to be top notch. The rich expect their shopping experiences to be at the highest level possible and Harrods needs to achieve this by both looking and acting the part. The Harrods Fine Jewelry room is a great example of a department that completely fits in with the brand narrative. The room has an enhanced private environment where customers can expect an entirely personalized shopping experience. The design of the space was inspired by Harrods’ archives and set out to recreate the historical ambiance of its jewelry department (Oliveira, 2016). The room has antique detailing, a gentle onyx color palette and polished brass, giving the space an elegant feel (2016). The room also includes bespoke lighting which is used to display jeweler’s collections in their most sparkling light (2016). Each brand has a dedicated space with a unique and breathtaking interior design. For instance, the Graff Diamonds boutique in Harrods has a striking gold exterior that is complemented by striped marble floors and decadent wall panels (The Jewelry Editor, 2014). Similarly, the Cartier boutique is lavished with handcrafted decorative walls, complemented by glass and bronze furnishings (Mann, 2017). It is safe to say that there are only a select number of people who are going to be walking through the jewelry department with intentions of actually purchasing something. The appearance of the jewelry department in Harrods needs to display pure wealth and elegance, or else customers will choose to purchase their jewelry elsewhere. To put it simply, if a person is willing to pay for fine jewelry, they will most likely choose to purchase the item at the place that fits in most with their identified class. The jewelry room in Harrods clearly represents the type of clientele the store is selling to.  \nAnother popular part of Harrods is the Super Brands department. Situated on the first and second floor of the building, this department features some of the biggest designers in the fashion industry. The two floors include top brands such as Prada, Chanel, Dior, and Alexander McQueen. The first floor is filled with women ready to wear, while the second floor is meant for men. Marble, black granite, bronze and brass are present throughout both floors, and each brand has its own space in an intimate setting. The layout of the department creates a ‘boutique-within-a-boutique’ effect that caters to Harrods’ luxury clientele (Harrods Superbrands, n.d.). The lighting is intentionally low to create more of an ambiance and set the tone of the department. Both floors are filled with personal shoppers who are designated to specific brands. There aren’t as many kids and random tourists browsing through these two floors. The Super Brands department truly reinforces Harrods’ status as the world’s premier high fashion retailer. \nThe customers who browse through Harrods also stand out. When walking around the store, it becomes apparent that nobody is dressed inappropriately. This is because Harrods introduced a dress code policy in 1989 that still applies today. The clothes people wear send a message, and Harrods does not want its brand to be associated with the wrong image. The book, The Fashioned Body: Fashion, Dress and Modern Social Theory, says that “Fashion and dress have a complex relationship to identity: on the one hand the clothes we choose to wear can be expressive… telling others something about our gender, class, status and so on; on the other our clothes cannot always be read, since they do not speak and can therefore be open to misinterpretation” (Entwistle, 2000). To avoid this misinterpretation, Harrods has the right to deny entry to anyone wearing attire that they consider to be inappropriate. Proper attire, including tops and shirts, must be worn at all times and visible tattoos and clothing that contain objectionable language or designs are not permitted. This is a way to filter out the customers who do not look like they belong in a place like Harrods. The department store is making it extremely clear that they are not in the same category as Primark. Even though they have adapted their dress code to modern times, Harrods still has a reputation to uphold and they try to manage this by having somewhat of a say in who walks into their store. \nTo conclude, Harrods is famous for its high quality image and the atmosphere that comes along with it. The glamorous interior of the store reflects the nature of the brand and depicts the type of customer Harrods is selling to. Harrods is the perfect example of a department store that is unapologetically meant for the upper class and isn’t afraid to make that known. Top level customers are given the most excellent service and the most amazing product, in the best possible environment. Harrods is truly a symbol of social class, making it no surprise that it is the most famous luxury department store in the world. \nReferences\nEntwistle, J. (2000).
