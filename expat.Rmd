Andrew Braathan did not have the traditional upbringing. He grew up in Brazil and eventually moved to the United States to attend the University of Houston, where he studied Hotel and Restaurant Management. After completing his undergraduate degree, he began his career working for a cruise line company that was based in Miami. He worked in Miami for a couple of years but eventually received a job opportunity in Brazil and had to move back. However the transition back to Brazil wasn't as easy as Andrew thought it would be and he had to relearn the Brazilian way of doing business. He ended up working in Brazil for another 13 years before making the move back to the United States in 2015 where he has been living ever since. After having lived half of his life in Brazil and the other half in the United States, Andrew has learned many cultural lessons that he was willing to share with anyone interested in working internationally one day. 

Having to work in Brazil after beginning his professional career in the United States was a much harder transition for Andrew than vice versa. When he moved back to Brazil, he had to relearn how to communicate more formally with his clients and suppliers. The United States is also a much more individualistic culture than Brazil which meant that Andrew had to adjust his mindset to be more collectivistic. Brazilians strongly believe in placing the interests of others before their own, and there is an emphasis on trust and building long lasting relationships. It was difficult for Andrew to adjust back to a culture where group identity was emphasized and where an indirect communication style was more common. However when he moved back to the States, it was easier for Andrew to switch back to an individualistic mindset.

According to Andrew, the biggest difference between doing business in the United States versus in Brazil is the interaction style. Contrary to the United States, Brazil has a much more formal and indirect communication style. This meant that Andrew couldn't just say no and disagree with his colleagues in Brazil the same way he did in the States because they would take it personally. Communicating in an indirect way was a big challenge for Andrew since he was coming from the United States which has a very direct communication style. In addition to being more formal, Brazilians are much more informative than Americans and like to explain things before they ask you to do something. They want you to understand the reasoning behind a request to avoid any confusion about a particular task. "Brazilians like to give more information whereas over here in the States it's a little bit more cut and dry," Andrew recalled. \

Andrew's main takeaway from working in both Brazil and the United States is that it's so important to be flexible. Anyone who is looking to work internationally should be able to multitask and be open to doing different jobs at the same time. No matter how similar two countries may appear, there are always differences that will set them apart. Andrew's ability to be flexible and adapt to the local culture and business environment in both the United States and Brazil is what has helped him succeed. Furthermore, having a diverse skill set and always being willing to learn new things is crucial when working abroad. 

Andrew's advice for a future expat is to not be afraid to work in different parts of the world and explore various industries along the way. "Everything will help you be a better person, employee, business owner, etc because you have that experience," he mentioned. Additionally, knowing more than one language is a skill that is so important to have. When he was working in Miami, Andrew watched firsthand how some people weren't given as many opportunities simply because they couldn't communicate with their employees. He saw his boss turn extremely qualified people down because they didn't know Spanish. Knowing multiple languages is so important and can only benefit someone who is trying to integrate themselves into a new culture.
