-   I'm a 22 year old college senior who is graduating in about a month

-   I hope to work in the fashion industry post grad

-   I've lived on the East Coast my entire life (Central Jersey for the win) but am hoping to moving out West after graduation

-   I absolutely love to travel and spent a year abroad in Paris and London. Hands down one of the best experiences of my life.

-   I'm a Scorpio - October 24th 1998.

-   My mom is from Colombia and Spanish was actually my first language.

-   I'm obsessed with French Bulldogs (and have two)
